# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Before running WiseMindOS locally, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- MongoDB (local installation or MongoDB Atlas)
- Git

Verify your installation:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
git --version
```

Then immediately follow it with:



## Quick Start

Follow these steps to run WiseMindOS on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aaryan498/WiseMindOS.git
cd WiseMindOS
```

### 2. Create Backend Environment Variables

Navigate to the backend folder and create a `.env` file:

```bash
cd backend
```

Add the following:

```env 
PORT=4000
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=replace_with_a_secure_random_string
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
IMAGEKIT_PUBLIC_KEY=placeholder_public_key
IMAGEKIT_PRIVATE_KEY=placeholder_private_key
IMAGEKIT_URL_ENDPOINT=placeholder_url_endpoint
```

or

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### 3. Create Frontend Environment Variables

Navigate to the frontend folder and create a `.env` file:

```bash
cd ../frontend
```

Add the following:

```env
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID:your_google_client_id
```

### 4. Install Backend Dependencies

Open a terminal in the `backend` folder and run:

```bash
npm install
```

### 5. Install Frontend Dependencies

Open a terminal in the `frontend` folder and run:

```bash
npm install
```

### 6. Start the Backend Server

Open **Terminal 1**:

```bash
cd WiseMindOS/backend
npm run dev
```

Wait until the backend starts successfully.

### 7. Start the Frontend Server

Open **Terminal 2**:

```bash
cd WiseMindOS/frontend
npm run dev
```

### 8. Open the Application

Once both servers are running, open the **Local** URL displayed in Terminal 2.

By default, it is usually:

```text
http://localhost:5173
```


### Project Running Order

1. Start MongoDB
2. Start the backend server (Terminal 1)
3. Start the frontend server (Terminal 2)
4. Open the application in your browser

---

## Troubleshooting

### Backend Fails to Start

* Verify that all required environment variables are configured correctly.
* Ensure your MongoDB instance is running and the connection string is valid.
* Reinstall dependencies if required:

```bash
npm install
```

### Frontend Fails to Start

* Verify that all frontend environment variables are configured correctly.
* Make sure dependencies are installed:

```bash
npm install
```

### Frontend Cannot Connect to Backend

* Ensure the backend server is running.
* Verify that `VITE_BACKEND_URL` points to the correct backend URL.

### Port Already in Use
- If the application fails to start because a port is already in use, stop the conflicting process or update the port configuration.
